      "Oliver's mentoring was exactly what I needed. His pitch course gave me the confidence and clarity to make my project stand out. Every session felt like a deep dive, with honest feedback, smart strategy, and no fluff. I left with a solid pitch, a clearer direction, and a much stronger sense of where I fit in the industry."
