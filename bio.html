      <h1>About Oliver Park</h1>
      <p>Director and screenwriter known for The Offering, released by Lionsgate, available on Netflix.</p>
      <p>With a background in writing and directing acclaimed short films including the critically acclaimed Vicious, I transitioned into studio filmmaking after selling a pitch to a major studio, where my work continues to explore grounded, character-driven horror with commercial appeal. While currently attached to a number of upcoming studio projects in the genre space,</p>
      <p>I am now offering private mentorship to emerging writers, directors, and actors, helping them navigate the industry and bring your own projects to life. <a href="./mentorship.html">Learn More</a></p>
