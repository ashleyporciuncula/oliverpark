    <h1>1:1 Mentorship for Filmmakers & Actors</h1>

    <h2>Tailored Support for Every Stage of Your Career</h2>

    <p>Whether you're just starting out or already building momentum, this mentorship is designed to meet you where you are. I offer personal, practical, one-on-one coaching for writers, directors, and performers navigating the real world of film and television, from indie to studio.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Story and script development – from creation to sale</li>
      <li>Standing out and getting seen</li>
      <li>Self-tapes and audition tips and tricks</li>
      <li>Pitching and pitch deck refinement</li>
      <li>Film festivals</li>
      <li>Moving from short to feature</li>
      <li>Getting an agent</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These sessions are grounded in industry experience, with a focus on the questions that come up again and again:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Should I go to film school?</li>
      <li>How do I get an agent; or better yet, how do I make agents want me?</li>
      <li>What's the best way to meet producers and build meaningful connections?</li>
      <li>What makes a pitch or script compelling enough to stand out?</li>
      <li>Should I be writing a short or a feature right now?</li>
      <li>How do I move from indie to studio; or from short films to features?</li>
      <li>What should I expect from film festivals, and how do I get in?</li>
      <li>How do I get seen as a self-directing actor or filmmaker?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you're asking yourself any of these questions, this mentorship is designed for you. Every session is customised to your goals and current challenges, helping you take clear, confident steps forward.</p>

    <h2>Session Cost</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Free</b> 20 min intro call</li>
      <li><b>£75</b> for one 60-min private Zoom session</li>
      <li><b>£270</b> for a bundle of 4 sessions (10% discount)</li>
      <li>Shared sessions also available, such as student groups.</li>
    </ul>    

    <h2>Funding Support</h2>
    <p>The ScreenSkills bursary can cover up to 80% of your costs. For example, if you were to do 20 sessions, instead of paying £1350, you would pay only £270. My producer and I will guide you through the application - it's simple, fully supported, and anything you've already paid is applied to the total if you're approved.</p>  

    <h2>
      "Oliver's mentoring was exactly what I needed. His pitch course gave me the confidence and clarity to make my project stand out. Every session felt like a deep dive, with honest feedback, smart strategy, and no fluff. I left with a solid pitch, a clearer direction, and a much stronger sense of where I fit in the industry."
    </h2>
    <p>Ashley, Producer Writer and Director</p>
