    <h1>1:1 Mentorship for Filmmakers & Actors</h1>
    <p>Practical, personalised support to help you move forward in your screen career—whether you're acting, writing, directing, or just starting out. These one-on-one sessions are grounded in real industry experience, with credits across Netflix, Lionsgate, Warner Bros, and more.</p>
    <p>Every session is customised and focused on what actually makes a difference:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Scripts, scenes, or reels</li>
      <li>Pitches, self-tapes, or festival submissions</li>
      <li>Navigating agents, funding, or the next career step</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Session Cost</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>£75</strong> for one 60-min private Zoom session</li>
      <li><strong>£270</strong> for a bundle of 4 sessions (10% discount)</li>
      <li>Shared sessions also available, such as student groups.</li>
    </ul>    

    <h2>Funding Support</h2>
    <p>The ScreenSkills bursary can cover up to 80% of your costs. For example, if you were to do 20 sessions, instead of paying £1350, you would pay only £270.
    <p>My producer and I will guide you through the application—it’s simple, fully supported, and anything you’ve already paid is applied to the total if you're approved.</p>  

    <p>
      Not sure what you need? Get in touch for a <b style="color:#e7e2dd;">free 20 min intro call</b>. Let's talk and figure it out together.

      "Oliver's mentoring was exactly what I needed. His pitch course gave me the confidence and clarity to make my project stand out. Every session felt like a deep dive, with honest feedback, smart strategy, and no fluff. I left with a solid pitch, a clearer direction, and a much stronger sense of where I fit in the industry."
    </h2>
    <p>Ashley, Producer Writer and Director</p>
